    Useful for boxplots and scatterplots.

    axis_min -- the minimum y value exactly
    axis_max -- the maximum y value exactly

    Generally, we want box and scatter plots to have y-axes starting from just
    below the minimum point (e.g. lowest outlier). That is to avoid the common case
    where we have the y-axis start at 0, and all our values range tightly
    together. In which case, for boxplots, we will have a series of tiny
    boxplots up the top, and we won't be able to see the different parts of it
    e.g. LQ, median etc. For scatter plots our data will be too tightly
    scrunched up to see any spread.

    But sometimes the lowest point is not that far above 0, in which case we
    should set it to 0. A 0-based axis is preferable unless the values are a
    long way away. Going from 0.5-12 is silly. Might as well go from 0-12.
    4 scenarios:

    1) min and max are both the same
    Just try to set the max differently to the min so there is a range on the
    axis to display. See implementation for more details.

    2) min and max are both +ve
    |   *
    |
    -------
    Snap min to 0 if gap small rel to range, otherwise make min y-axis just
    below min point. Make max y-axis just above the max point. Make the
    padding from 0 the least of 0.1 of axis_min and 0.1 of val_range. The
    outer padding can be the least of the axis_max and 0.1 of val_range.

    3) min and max are -ve
    -------
    |   *
    |
    Snap max to 0 if gap small rel to range, otherwise make max y-axis just
    above max point. Make min y-axis just below min point. Make the
    padding the least of 0.1 of gap and 0.1 of val_range.

    4) min is -ve and max is +ve
    |   *
    -------
    |   *
    Make max 1.1 * axis_max. No harm if 0.
    Make min 1.1 * axis_min. No harm if 0.
